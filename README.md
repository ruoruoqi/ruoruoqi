I'm currently a student at Monash University, studying IT and Geographical Science with an interest in computer networks and systems. In my free time I like going for walks with my dog and indulging in my granny hobbies of knitting and crocheting.

Right now I am working on expanding my tech knowledge and developing my skills as a programmer, please don't hesistate to reach out if you'd like to connect!
